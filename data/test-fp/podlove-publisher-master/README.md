## Development Environment

Any WordPress development environment with a PHP version of at least 5.4 will do. A Vagrant Virtual Machine using the [Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) configuration is recommended.

## Development

Code dependencies are managed via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). So you need to clone the repository and then fetch the dependencies via Composer.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/podlove/podlove-publisher.git
cd podlove-publisher
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar --dev install
npm run submodules-init
```

## Testing

You need a dedicated database for testing because _running tests wipes all data_. To setup tests, run this once:

```
# bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh <database> <user> <password> <host> <wordpress-version>
bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root root localhost latest
```

This will download the latest WordPress core and files required for testing into `/tmp`.

Then run `phpunit` to run the tests.

```
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

#### Web Player

To get and update the web player v3+, use bower and make:

```
bower update
make player
```
