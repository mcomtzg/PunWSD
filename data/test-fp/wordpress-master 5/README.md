# Twitter plugin for WordPress

The Twitter plugin for WordPress optimizes your website for a Twitter audience through easy to use sharing buttons, embedded Tweets, embedded timelines, auto-generated markup indexed by Twitter, and Follow buttons to help grow your Twitter audience. All features are deeply integrated with WordPress APIs to make building your webpages and administrative features as easy as possible with the extensibility you expect from WordPress.

The Twitter plugin for WordPress requires PHP 5.4 or greater to take advantage of [traits](http://php.net/manual/language.oop5.traits.php), [late static bindings](http://php.net/manual/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php) for extensibility, [namespaces](http://php.net/manual/language.namespaces.rationale.php), and Twitter libraries. Embedded Tweets require a server capable of communicating with Twitter's servers over TLS/SSL; the [cURL library](http://php.net/manual/book.curl.php) typically works best.

Current version: `2.0.1`

## Features

Individual features may be toggled off through the `twitter_features` filter.

Features built on top of oEmbed APIs omit JavaScript from the oEmbed response, asynchronously loading JavaScript through the WordPress JavaScript queue. An asynchronous JavaScript function queue is available for Twitter's widgets JavaScript and universal website tracking JavaScript to register dependencies such as an analytics tracker.

Easily track activity on your WordPress site with JavaScript and other resources optimally loaded through WordPress.

## Code structure

The plugin is split into PHP object builders for constructing buttons, widgets, and cards and validating parameters. WordPress-specific code exists under `src/Twitter/WordPress/`. Coding standards therefore vary between PSR style (e.g. space indent) and WordPress style (e.g. tab indent) based on directory and its target runtime environment.
